# ArubaOS 8 REST API Scripts

## Purpose:
This repository contains Python scripts that can be used as an example of how to interact with the ArubaOS 8 RESTful API on devices such as Mobility Conductors and Mobility Controllers.
> Get the AOS 8 API Documentation [here](https://developer.arubanetworks.com/aruba-aos/docs/getting-started-aos8-restapi).

## Caution!
Please review this code before running. You will need to modify certain parts to work with your environment.

## Prerequisites:
You will only need the following to work with these scripts:
- Any Text Editor
- Python 3
- Aruba Endpoints

## What will I need to modify?
The primary requirement is to look over the *[sample_session.json](sample_session.json)* file and modify the *(username)*, *(password)*, and *(ip-addr)* placeholder values, leaving the double-quotes intact. The file will also need to be renamed or saved as *session.json*.
